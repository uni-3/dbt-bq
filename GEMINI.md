# Gemini Customization File

This file is used to customize and guide Gemini's behavior for this project. You can add instructions here to ensure Gemini follows specific coding conventions, uses certain libraries, or adheres to any other project-specific guidelines.

For example, you could specify:
- "Use `uv` for python package management."
- "Always run `dbt build` after making changes to models."
- "Prefer `dbt_utils.star` over writing custom macros for common data transformations."

Gemini will refer to this file for context when assisting with development tasks.
